The plan involves two main components:

1. `unit_converter.py`: This file contains the core business logic for unit conversion, including functions to convert length, weight, and temperature units. It also includes a main function to handle user input and call the appropriate conversion function.

2. `cli.py`: This file implements a Typer CLI wrapper to provide a command-line interface for the unit converter. It imports the conversion functions from `unit_converter.py` and provides commands for each type of conversion.

This architecture is viable as it separates the core logic from the command-line interface, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.
