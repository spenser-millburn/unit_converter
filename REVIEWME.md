The script looks mostly correct, but there are a few potential issues to consider:

1. Import Statements: Ensure that the `unit_converter` module and its functions (`length_conversion`, `weight_conversion`, `temperature_conversion`) are correctly installed and accessible in your environment.

2. Function Definitions: Verify that the functions `length_conversion`, `weight_conversion`, and `temperature_conversion` accept the parameters `(value, from_unit, to_unit)` and return the expected results.

3. Typer Installation: Ensure that the `typer` library is installed in your environment. You can install it using `pip install typer`.

4. Typo in the Shebang Line: If you intend to run this script directly from the command line, you might want to add a shebang line at the top of the script to specify the Python interpreter. For example:
   ```
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   ```

5. Permissions: Make sure the script has execute permissions if you intend to run it directly from the command line:
   ```
   chmod +x cli.py
   ```

If all these points are addressed, the script should work as intended.
